## Introduction
A Vector Store is a data structure that allows for the storage and manipulation of vectors. Vectors are mathematical objects that have both magnitude and direction. This project aims to provide a basic implementation of a Vector Store, which can be further expanded and optimized as per specific requirements.

## Installation
To run this project, it is recommended to set up a virtual environment and install the necessary dependencies. Follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the repository to your local machine.**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/valiantlynx/simple-vector-store.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory.**
   ```
   cd simple-vector-store
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment.**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment.**
   ```
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. **Install the required dependencies.**
   ```
   pip install numpy
   ```

## Usage
To use the Vector Store in your own projects, follow the example code below:

```python
# Import the VectorStore class
from vectorstore import VectorStore

# Create an instance of the VectorStore
vector_store = VectorStore()

# Add a vector to the store
vector_store.add_vector(vector_id, vector_data)

# Retrieve a vector from the store
vector = vector_store.get_vector(vector_id)

# Update the index of a vector in the store
vector_store.update_index(vector_id, updated_vector_data)

# Find similar vectors in the store based on a query vector
similar_vectors = vector_store.find_similar_vectors(query_vector, num_results)
```
Make sure to replace `vector_id`, `vector_data`, `updated_vector_data`, `query_vector`, and `num_results` with appropriate values as per your specific use case.
